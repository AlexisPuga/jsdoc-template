# Contributing

First of all, thank you for contributing to this project.

All contributions are welcome, but they should follow a set of guidelines. This document describes which are those guidelines.

Feel free to propose any change to this document in a **Pull Request** and remember that any interaction with this project must adhere to our Code of Conduct.

## Code of conduct

This project and any interaction with it follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By interacting with this project, you are expected to adhere to this code.

## Process

The process to contribute is simple:
- Want to make an enhancement or fix something? Open an **Issue** and describe your solution/problem, or use a **Pull Request** to submit your code.
- Anything else? Open an **Issue**.

### Requisites

Remember that this is *kind of a Fork* and everything was implemented trying to make minor changes to the [default template](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc/templates/default) in order to make updates faster (if something from his side fails or is buggy). 

Either way...
- Any changes/fixes/enhancements to tmpl/css/js/config/example/webpack files are allowed.
- Changes to publish.js might not be allowed.
- Minor design changes are allowed, major ones (that change the essence of this design) might not.

Aren't sure? Create an **Issue**.

#### Formatting

For **Issues** or **Pull Requests** there's not a predefined format, just try to be clear.

For commits just check the previous commits to give you an idea.

### Development

To add something to this template, you should:
1. Fork the project to your account.
2. Clone your Fork.
3. Enter to the local copy of the project.

Then... start developing your feature.
1. Create a new branch from master (use a descriptive name).
2. Run ``` npm run development ``` from a CLI.
3. Open ``` localhost:9000 ``` from your browser.
4. Modify any js/css file to reload the configuration.

When your feature is ready, push your branch to your **Fork** and open a **Pull Request** with your new branch.
